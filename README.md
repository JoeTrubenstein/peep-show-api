# Peep Show API

An unofficial fan-made API for fetching [Peep Show](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/peep-show) data.

## Currently deployed at

[https://peep-show-api.herokuapp.com/](https://peep-show-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

* [Django](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) 
* [Django REST framework](https://maven.apache.org/) 

## Contributing

I would be thrilled if anyone would want to collaborate on this project.

I'll be putting together contributing guidelines in the near future.

What will be needed in the short term - is a lot of data entry, 
as well as a decision on exactly what models will be used and how they will be defined. 

Currently there is only a single model ```characters``` and a single entry, Super Hans.
